****Intelligent Player for "Fianco" using Alpha-Beta Pruning and Negamax****

This project implements an intelligent player for the Italian game "Fianco" using the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm with Negamax notation. The implementation leverages Pygame for visualizing the game and Zobrist hashing for efficient board state evaluation. The goal of this project is to participate in the Intelligence and Search Games competition at Maastricht University.

**Features**

Alpha-Beta Pruning with Negamax: Efficient game tree search to minimize the number of nodes evaluated.
Zobrist Hashing: Fast and effective board state hashing to avoid redundant calculations.
Pygame Integration: Interactive GUI to visualize the game and the AI player's moves in real-time.
Customizable Gameplay: Play against the AI or let the AI play against itself.

**Requirements**

Python 3.x
Pygame
Numpy
